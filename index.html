  <p>On 26 August, few years ago, billions of people was living a normal life except a couple in Muradnagar. Mr. and Mrs. Lalwan was expecting their 1st child. On that day Mrs. Lalwan was rushed to the hospital and gave birth to a miracle later known as Shivani.
  From the day she is born, her beauty is increasing day by day. After few years she became elder sister. She always loved her near and dear ones.</p>
